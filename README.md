As a Growth Analyst at Sera, an international SaaS company that provides its clients with financial information for investments. Clients subscribe on a monthly basis. Sera wants to use its data on subscription payments to better understand sales trends and customer retention over time. I was tasked with designing a transformed database for analysis and a dashboard that answers key business questions. Essentially, I assumed the role of a Data Engineer to transform the database into a more workable format before analyzing and visualizing the data to proffer actionable insights as a Growth Analyst.
